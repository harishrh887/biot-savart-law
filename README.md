# Biot-savart-law 


***Introduction***

Biot–Savart’s Law is a fundamental law in **electromagnetism** that explains how **magnetic fields are generated by electric currents.**
It was discovered experimentally by **Jean-Baptiste Biot** and **Félix Savart** in 1820.
Just as **Coulomb’s law** gives the electric field due to a point charge, Biot–Savart’s law gives the **magnetic field due to a small current element.**
It helps in determining the **magnitude and direction** of the **magnetic field** produced at any point in space by a **steady current.**


***Explanation***

When an electric current flows through a conductor, it produces a magnetic field around it.
To calculate this field at a given point, Biot–Savart’s Law considers a very small segment of the conductor carrying a current.

Let:
	
  - I = current through the conductor
	
  - d**l** = small length element of the conductor
	
  - **r** = position vector from the element to the observation point
	
  - `r` = unit vector from the element to the point
	
  - d**B** = small magnetic field produced by d**l**



***Direction of Magnetic Field***

•	The direction of ( d\mathbf{B} ) is perpendicular to both ( d\mathbf{l} ) and ( \mathbf{r} ).

•	Determined using the Right-Hand Rule:
Point your thumb along the current ( I ) (or ( d\mathbf{l} )),
and your fingers towards the point where the field is observed;
the palm shows the direction of ( d\mathbf{B} ).

where,
	
  - μ_0=4π×10^(-7) " T cdotpm A" is the **permeability of free space,**
	
  - dl×r ̂represents the **vector cross product**, giving the direction of the field using the **right-hand rule.**

***Magnetic Field Due to a Long Straight Current-Carrying Wire***

 By integrating the Biot–Savart Law along the entire length of a wire:

  For an infinitely long straight wire:

where Ris the perpendicular distance from the wire to the point of observation.

This integral sums the magnetic field contributions from all current elements along the conductor.

***Key Features***
-	Magnetic field ( B ) is directly proportional to:
  
-	the current ( I )
  
-	the length element ( dl )
  
-	the sine of the angle between ( d\mathbf{l} ) and ( \mathbf{r} )
  
-	( B ) is inversely proportional to the square of the distance ( r^2 ).

-	The law applies to any shape of current-carrying conductor (straight wire, circular loop, solenoid, etc.).

-	It forms the basis for Ampere’s Law and helps derive the magnetic field at the center of a circular coil.


***Limitations of Biot–Savart Law***

While the Biot–Savart Law is a powerful tool for understanding magnetostatics, it has several ***limitations*** and ***assumptions*** that restrict its applicability:


***1.Applicable Only for Steady Currents***

- The law assumes that the current Iis constant with time.

- It does not apply to situations where current changes with time (i.e., time-varying currents), since that would produce changing magnetic and electric fields.

  
***Not Suitable for Time-Varying Electric Fields***

- When the electric field changes with time, an induced magnetic field appears according to   Faraday’s Law of Induction.
 
- The Biot–Savart Law does not consider this effect.
  
- In such cases, the more general Maxwell’s Equations must be used.
 
***Neglects Relativistic Effects***

- The law assumes that the current-carrying charges move much slower than the speed of light.

- At relativistic speeds, the relationship between electric and magnetic fields becomes more complex, and the Biot–Savart law becomes inaccurate.
 
***Valid Only for Magnetostatic Conditions***

- It assumes the magnetic field is static (does not vary with time).
  
- It cannot describe electromagnetic waves or radiation phenomena where fields propagate through space.
  
***Difficult for Complex Geometries***

- The Biot–Savart Law requires integration over the entire current distribution, which can be mathematically complex for irregular conductor shapes.
 
- Numerical or computational methods are often needed for such systems.
  
***Assumes Continuous Current Distribution***

- The law treats current as a continuous flow of charge, ignoring the discrete nature of electrons
  .
- At microscopic or quantum scales, this assumption breaks down.
 
***Does Not Include Magnetic Materials***

- The law is derived for free space or vacuum (μ=μ_0).

- In presence of magnetic materials (like iron or ferrite), magnetic permeability varies, and the law becomes less accurate without modifications



  




***Graphical Representation***

- The direction of d**B** is **perpendicular** to both the direction of current (dl) and the line    joining the element to the observation point (r) — following the **right-hand rule.**

- The vector ( d\mathbf{B} ) forms a circle around the conductor.

- At any point around the wire, the field lines are tangential to the circular path and perpendicular to the wire.
  
- Thus, the magnetic field due to a current-carrying conductor forms concentric circles around the wire.




***Conclusion***

Biot – Savart’s Law provides a **precise mathematical description** of the magnetic field generated by steady currents.
It is a **cornerstone of classical electromagnetism**, forming the foundation for **Ampere’s law** and **Maxwell’s equations.**
By understanding this law, we can analyze magnetic fields produced by various current configurations, which is crucial in **electrical, electronic, and magnetic devices.**
