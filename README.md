# Biot-savart-law 

***Introduction***

Biot–Savart’s Law is a fundamental law in **electromagnetism** that explains how **magnetic fields are generated by electric currents.**
It was discovered experimentally by **Jean-Baptiste Biot** and **Félix Savart** in 1820.
Just as **Coulomb’s law** gives the electric field due to a point charge, Biot–Savart’s law gives the **magnetic field due to a small current element.**
It helps in determining the **magnitude and direction** of the **magnetic field** produced at any point in space by a **steady current.**

***Explanation***

When an electric current flows through a conductor, it produces a magnetic field around it.
To calculate this field at a given point, Biot–Savart’s Law considers a very small segment of the conductor carrying a current.

Let:
	
  - I = current through the conductor
	
  - d**l** = small length element of the conductor
	
  - **r** = position vector from the element to the observation point
	
  - `r` = unit vector from the element to the point
	
  - d**B** = small magnetic field produced by d**l**

where,
	
  - μ_0=4π×10^(-7) " T cdotpm A" is the **permeability of free space,**
	
  - dl×r ̂represents the **vector cross product**, giving the direction of the field using the **right-hand rule.**

***Magnetic Field Due to a Long Straight Current-Carrying Wire***

 By integrating the Biot–Savart Law along the entire length of a wire:

  For an infinitely long straight wire:

where Ris the perpendicular distance from the wire to the point of observation.

This integral sums the magnetic field contributions from all current elements along the conductor.


***Applications of Biot–Savart’s Law***
	
 1.  **Magnetic field at the center of a circular loop:**

  2. **Magnetic field due to a straight current-carrying wire.**
	
  3. **Used in Ampere’s Circuital Law derivation** — helps relate magnetic field and current.
	
  4. **Used to find the field of solenoids and toroids**.
	
  5. **Design of electromagnets and inductors** in electrical engineering.
	
  6. **MRI scanners and magnetic sensors** also rely on magnetic field calculations derived from this law.



***Graphical Representation***

The direction of d**B** is **perpendicular** to both the direction of current (dl) and the line    joining the element to the observation point (r) — following the **right-hand rule.**

***Conclusion***

Biot – Savart’s Law provides a **precise mathematical description** of the magnetic field generated by steady currents.
It is a **cornerstone of classical electromagnetism**, forming the foundation for **Ampere’s law** and **Maxwell’s equations.**
By understanding this law, we can analyze magnetic fields produced by various current configurations, which is crucial in **electrical, electronic, and magnetic devices.**
